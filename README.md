# TableZone_website
My project is about an E-commerce website selling different kinds of board games. For developing it, I first created a front page, which is the landing page of our website where wI just used HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and after that I started working on backend where I used PHP and MYSQL, where I developed features like add to cart, make changes to cart, and final check out page. I have ended up with a fully functional e-commerce website which is ready to use.
